# Lesson 01 -- Overview and Introduction

## Learning Objectives -- by the end of the lesson you will be able to
 * explain what is in the syllabus and have all of your questions answered
 * know how to apply for an account on the Computer Science servers
 * download the book "The Linux Command Line (5th edition)"
 * use chatGPT to generate (possibly buggy) code meeting your specifications


## Activity -- Large Language Models and Computer Science Education
This is a very interesting time for Computer Science.

The recent development (and release) of large language model AI systems (e.g. chatGPT, github-copilot, GPT-J, huggingface, ...) is likely to have a major impact on the way we use computers to solve important problems.  These tools can generate code (though it is sometimes incorrect) based on English text explaining what the code should do and what language it should be in (java, python, bash, rust, go, ...)

Rather than ban the use of these tools, we will explore how they can be used to help accelerate your learning of Software Engineering skills, concepts, and tools. I will need your help in this endeavor as this is all new for everyone.

## Activity -- Course Overview
We will now review the syllabus and talk about what you will be able to do after you complete this course, provided you work hard and make use of the instructor and TA office hours when you don't fully understand something. 

## Activity -- Intro to MLA (the Mastery Learning App)
We have everyone connect to the MLA account for this class
Visit https://mastery.cs.brandeis.edu and enter the PIN that I give in class

We will use this to have you ask questions and respond to each other and answer questions I pose.

## Activity -- Learning about the shell
We begin to learn about the shell by looking over [these webpages](https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php) in The Linux Command Line website.
