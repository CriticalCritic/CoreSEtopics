We continue going through the [React tutorial](https://react.dev/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-react-dev)

We'll start by skimming the tutorial to build the TicTacToe game and we'll point out the key steps...

We'll show how to download from codeSandbox and run locally (File->Export to Zip -> git audit fix --force multiple times)

Or you can just checkout the main branch of the cs103aspr23 site to get the code we wrote yesterday.

Then, we will continue working on the todolist app in React and we'll do this in steps with you doing most of the work.
The goal is for you to become comfortable with the syntax and underlying model of React programming (for single page apps)
* add a delete button
* add a completed button (which is a toggle)
* add a priority field
* add a button to hide the completed tasks (toggle)
* add a feature to access an express app API (or any other API)

Next week we'll look at using nextjs to create apps and we'll look into multipage apps and routing.
