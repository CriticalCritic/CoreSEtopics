# Grade Calculation
We begin with an MLA problem to calculate your current grade
and make a plan for how to maintain or improve your grade in the next 3 weeks.


# Deployment
We start of the lesson with a quick overview of how to deploy a webapp.
One of the most common approaches is to use Amazon Web Services (AWS).  This requires a credit card,
so we will not cover it in this class. One free approach is glitch.com which allows you to run express servers
for free (even importing from github).


# React
Now we'll start the last unit of the class and begin to learn how to use the React framework to develop webapps
that are mostly client-side apps.

We'll start with the tutorials on the [react-dev site](https://react.dev/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-react-dev)

React is a client-side framework where most of the code for the app is downloaded to the browser initially. 
In express, the server creates new pages each time the user hits a link or submits a form.
In React, the browser only requests info from the server using API calls (with axios for example) and all links
and forms are handled locally in the browser!.  Data can be persisted by storing it locally on the computer running
the browser, this makes many individual use apps easy to write as there is no interactive server component or database.
