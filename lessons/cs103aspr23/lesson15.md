# Writing Web Applications in Python with Flask

We'll be going over the [Quickstart tutorial](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/quickstart/#a-minimal-application)
at the [Flask website](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/)

## simple example
Here is a minimal example 
``` python
''' hello.py is a simple webserver '''
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello_world():
    return "<p>Hello, World!</p>"

if __name__=='__main__':
    app.run(debug=True,port=5001)
```
We need to first install the flask package
``` bash
pip3 install flask
```
and run this as usual
``` bash
python3 hello.py
```
and we can then access the webserver by visiting the following link:
[http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001)


## the app.route decorator @app.route(PATH)
Flask specifies server behavior using the @app.route(/PATH) decorator
which precedes the function that is to be called when the user visits that PATH.

decorators are "syntactic sugar" for applying a function to a defined function after it is defined, e.g.
the following two code snippets are equivalent 
``` python
def f(arg):
    ...
f = g(f)
f = h(a)(f)
#---------------
@g
@h(a)
def f(arg):
    ...
```
where we assume that we have already defined a function g whose argument is a function and which returns a function.
Likewise h(a) must take a function argument and return a function.

In this case, app.route(PATH) modifies the app server so that it responds to the path http://domain/PATH by calling the function.


## Sessions
Next we look at a more complex example in which we use cookies to maintain state during a session.

Webservers are designed to be stateless... that is they process each incoming request from a browser
independently of all other requests.  When a user visits a website though they usually only login once
and every other time they visit the site, they don't have to repeat the login information.  This is done
by having the browsers store info from the server (called a cookie) and send it back whenever it visits that
same server. The Flask session handles all of this for us and lets imagine that the server has a dictionary
for each user that visits the site. The dictionary usually resets to an empty dictionary if the browser doesn't
visit the site for some fixed time.

When we impot the session dictioary from flask it allows us to store dictionary values in the cookies
sent between the server and the browser. Here is an example.



``` python

from flask import session,request,redirect,url_for,Flask


app = Flask(__name__)

# Set the secret key to some random bytes. Keep this really secret!
app.secret_key = b'_5#y2L"F4Q8z\n\xec]/'

@app.route('/')
def index():
    if 'username' in session:
        return f'Logged in as {session["username"]}'
    return 'You are not logged in'

@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        session['username'] = request.form['username']
        return redirect(url_for('index'))
    return '''
        <form method="post">
            <p><input type=text name=username>
            <p><input type=submit value=Login>
        </form>
    '''

@app.route('/logout')
def logout():
    # remove the username from the session if it's there
    session.pop('username', None)
    return redirect(url_for('index'))

if __name__=='__main__':
    app.run(debug=True,port=5001)
    
```

This example also shows how the flask server can get info from a user (via an HTML form) and send it back

## GET and POST requests
Each request from a browser is either a GET request (for example from clicking a link or cut/pasting in a URL into a browser)
or a POST request (for example, from filling out a form and pressing the submit button). The ``` login``` route above
shows the standard way to get info from a user (by sending them a form to fill out) and how to read the data they send (using the
request.form dictionary)

In this example, when the user logs in, we store their username in the session dictionary with the 'username' key
When they visit the '/logout' route, we pop the 'username' key out of the dictionary.

## JINJA
Mixing Python and HTML code makes for confusing programs and is not tenable for large applications.
Flask apps usually use the [JINJA](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/) templating engine to separate markup code (HTML) from Python code.

Below is a more complex model which uses JINJA templating and also stores data in a REDIS repository
This example is in a folder ``` flash_demo`` containing the following files and folders:
``` 
flash_demo.py

static
   hello.txt

templates:
   counter.html
   index.html
   layout.html
   login.html
```
and we run it using the command
``` bash
python3 flash_demo.py
```


## Layout and inheritance of templates
Below is the file layout.html
which defines the shape of all webpage generated by this server.
It also shows how JINJA mixes HTML (where the markup is given by \<tags\>)
and python (which is enclosed in {%....%} delimiters for control structures
and {{....}} delimiters for expressions
This layout will create a webpage with some messages at the top
and some content (using the block body tag) at the bottom




    
``` html
<!doctype html>
<title>My Application</title>
{% with messages = get_flashed_messages() %}
  {% if messages %}
    <ul class=flashes>
    {% for message in messages %}
      <li>{{ message }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  {% endif %}
{% endwith %}
{% block body %}{% endblock %}

```
    
### index.html
Here is the index.html file which will be rendered for the "/" route
``` html
{% extends "layout.html" %}
{% block body %}
  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>Welcome {{name}}</p>
  <p>Visit the <a href="{{url_for('counter')}}">counter page</a></p>
  <p>Visit a static page:<a href="/static/hello.txt">hello.txt</a></p>
  <p>Do you want to <a href="{{ url_for('logout') }}">log out?</a>
{% endblock %}
```
It generates the html page by plugging in the "body" block into the block body section of layout.html

      
### login.html

``` html
{% extends "layout.html" %}
{% block body %}
  <h1>Login</h1>
  {% if error %}
    <p class=error><strong>Error:</strong> {{ error }}
  {% endif %}
  <form method=post>
    <dl>
      <dt>Username:
      <dd><input type=text name=username value="{{
          request.form.username }}">
      <dt>Password:
      <dd><input type=password name=password>
    </dl>
    <p><input type=submit value=Login>
  </form>
{% endblock %}
```
    
### counter.html
This page shows two counters.  
One (local_counter) that is only affected by the current session (even if there are thousands of simulataneous users)
and another that is affected by all users (global_counter)
``` html
{% extends "layout.html" %}
{% block body %}
  <h1>Testing</h1>
  <p>the counter shows the number of times you visited this page.
    It is reset when you go to the index page. The global is reset
    if anyone goes to the index page and is incremented if anyone visits
    that page. The local only resets when the user visits index or 
    refreshes the counter page.
  </p>
  <p>local_counter = {{local_counter}}</p>
  <p>global_counter = {{global_counter}}</p>
  <p><a href="{{url_for('counter')}}">refresh this page</a></p>
  <p>Visit a static page:<a href="/static/hello.txt">hello.txt</a></p>
  <p>Return to the <a href="{{url_for('index')}}">index page</a></p>
{% endblock %}


```
    
## Python code for the app   
    
This example shows two types of persistent data.

We have already seen how to maintain data for each session, but most webapps need to retain data between sessions as well,
e.g. to store usernames and passwords when someone signs up or logs in.  We'll show how to do this with the [SQLITE](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database later,
but for this example we will use the [redis](https://redis.io/) key/value server which we can think of as a dictionary web service.
Once you've installed the redis code, you can start it by the command
``` bash
redis-server
```
and this starts the server on the standard port, 6379, for redis.
Redis stands for "Remote Dictionary Service". You set key/value pairs using
``` r.set(key,value)``` and you get them with ```r.get(key)```
You need to import the redis package and create the redis interface with
a call to ```redis.Redis(host=...., port=..., db=...) ``` as shown below.

``` python
''' flash_demo.py shows how to persist data globally and between sessions ```
from flask import Flask, \
     flash, redirect, render_template, url_for, \
     request, session
import redis

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = b'_5#y2L"F4Q8z\n\xec]/'
r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    r.set('abc',0)
    session['counter']=0
    if 'username' in session:
        return render_template('index.html',name=session['username'])
    return redirect(url_for('login'))
    

@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    error = None
    if request.method == 'POST':
        if request.form['username'] != 'admin' or \
                request.form['password'] != 'secret':
            error = 'Invalid credentials'
        else:
            flash('You were successfully logged in')
            session['username']=request.form['username']
            return redirect(url_for('index'))
    return render_template('login.html', error=error)

@app.route('/logout')
def logout():
    session.pop('username')
    flash('user has been logged out')
    return redirect(url_for('index'))

@app.route('/counter')
def counter():
    r.set('abc',1+int(r.get('abc')))
    session['counter'] = 1 + session['counter']
    return render_template('counter.html',\
                           global_counter=int(r.get('abc')),\
                            local_counter=session['counter'])



if __name__=='__main__':
    app.run(debug=True,port=5001)

```
