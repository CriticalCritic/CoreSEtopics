# Lesson 37 MongoDB with Next
We begin by looking over the code in the L37 folder which shows how to connect a mongo database to a nextjs app.
This demo implements a todo list but without authentication. You can however create your own named list.
Get the code from our [github site](https://github.com/tjhickey724/cs103aspr23/tree/main/lesson37/first-nextjs-app) 

## Get everyone running the app
First we spend some time getting everyone to be able to run the app
and debugging the errors that arise

## Adding a "completed" field
Then we have everyone try to add a "completed" field to the app

## Authentication
We won't implement authentication (as we don't have time), but we'll give an overview of OAuth2
authentication
https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/providers/oauth
and you can use the NextAuth package to simplify this.
