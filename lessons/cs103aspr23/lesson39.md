# Overview/Review
Today we review all of the concepts we covered in the course and we complete the course evaluations.
We have two course evaluation, an official one which is being tested by the University and 
a Teaching Practices Survey which will give me much more detailed feedback about what works and what doesn't in this course.

This course provided a smorgasbord of software deveopment technologies (maybe the course should be called "Intro to Software Development")
and for each topic there are one or more courses you can take that go into greater detail on the concepts we covered here.

## Git
This is an essential tool that you will use in any software development job and that is required in many courses.
We covered the basics but there is a lot more you can do with such systems and you'll pick it up in any software
development job or internship. You should definitely use your git account as an ePortfolio and look into use the github.io
site to highlight your accomplishments.

## the Bash Shell
These are tools that you will use in almost every course and every software development job you take on. 
If you are a Computer Science major you will take CS131a Operating Systems which explains in great detail
the inner workings of Operating Systems like Linux, and in particular the firat assignment is often to write your 
own shell in Java. So take
* COSI 131a Operating Systems
* COSI 132b Distributed Data Management (131a is a prereq)


## Python Programming and Pandas with automated testing (pytest) and linting (pylint)
Python is one of the most common tools for Data Analysis and if you liked the work with Pandas then think
about taking the Machine Learning courses 
Automated testing and Continuous integration is an important skill that is sometimes taught in CS12b
and that is an essential part of any software development project. You can learn more about Data Science
using Python in 
* Cosi 129a: Introduction to Big Data Analysis
* COSI 143b Data Management for Data Science

## SQL
SQL is one of the best known relational database languages and if you want to know more about how Database
Management systems work, then take

# Surveys
Please help improve this course by completing the following surveys:
* my Teaching Practices Survey
* the prototype Course Evaluation survey


* COSI 127b Database Management Systems

## Web App development in NodeJS/Express/Mongoose/EJS
If you are interested in web app development then you can take a full semester course on this
* COSI 152a Web Application Development
or you can learn another web app framework (typically Ruby-based) in
* COSI 166b Capstone Project for Software Engineering

## Native App Development
You can take an entire semester course on Mobile App Development (usually in React Native)if you are interested:
* COSI 153a Mobile Application Development
