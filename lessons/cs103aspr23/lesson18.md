# Lesson 18 on SQL

## Motivation
Almost every major interactive computer science application interacts with a database at some point.  Websites like Facebook, eBay, Amazon, Twitter, etc. are all sophisticated interfaces to large databases. This week we will look at how to interact with a database using the Structured Query Language SQLite.  Many of the concepts behind SQL are similar to those we have just seen in pandas, they both operate on tables and have operations that can produce new tables from old ones using selection, projection, mapping, aggregation, etc. At the end of this week, you will have a good working knowledge of SQL and will be able write Python programs which interact with a SQL database.

## Learning Objectives -- by the end of the lesson you will be able to
* download and install sqlite
* use the sqlite shell to create tables, select rows from a table, perform aggregation on a table
* write Python programs which create a sqlite3 connection and interact with the database using SQL commands

## Activity -- Introduction to SQL and sqlite
We give an introduction to the core concepts of SQL and the main SQL shell commands.
Here is a list of [all SQLite shell commands.](https://www.sqlite.org/lang.html) 


The L18 branch of the cs103a github repository contains a jupyter notebook where we interact with a database using the sqlite3 module. 
We will show how to load in the Brandeis course data into a SQL database and to do similar kinds of analysis as we did with Pandas.

Here is the link to the L18 notebook [L18 SQL](https://github.com/tjhickey724/cs103aspr23)

You can learn more about SQL and Database Management from this book
[Database Systems Concepts](https://www.db-book.com/slides-dir/index.html)
which also had a comprehensive set of slides!
