# Persistence
Today we learn how to connect a mongo database to an express webapp. 
This will allow us to create signup/login pages for authentication
and to store and recall personal information on the webapp.

We could use SQL to do this, but in this class we will use a NOSQL database callend Mongodb
and we will use an Object Relational Model, called Mongoose.
