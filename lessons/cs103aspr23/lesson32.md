# More React
We continue going through the [React tutorial](https://react.dev/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-react-dev)

We'll start by skimming the tutorial to build the TicTacToe game and we'll point out the key steps...

We'll also work through the process of running the React app locally and using the codeSandbox to develop code.

Then, we will work on building a todolist app in React and we'll do this in steps.
* create a ToDoList component whose state contains a todolist (list of dictionaries)
* create a new todo component which will add the item to the todolist
* put in a delete action
* put in a completed field
* add a button to show only the non-completed todos
