# Bootstrap Icons
The [Bootstrap Icon library](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)
has over 1800 icons. The easiest way to access them, in my opinion,
is to add the icon css link into the head of your pages (in the layout.ejs file)

``` html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap-icons@1.10.3/font/bootstrap-icons.css">
```

and then when you click on an incon in the page listed above, it shows you the code you need to insert.
For example to insert a trashcan we use
``` html
<i class="bi bi-trash"></i>
```
