# numpy and pandas
Today we begin looking at two Python packages frequently used in Data Analysis projects.

Learning objectifes are:
* describe the ndarray data structure used in numpy and how it differs from the Python list data structure
* use numpy and matplotlib to create 2d and 3d plots of functions
* describe the data frame and series data structures used in pandas
* load a CSV file into a pandas data frame
* select subsets of rows and subsets of cols to create new data frames
* create new columns constructed from evaluating expressions on other columns

# numpy
[Numpy](https://numpy.org/) is a package for efficiently working with large multidimensional arrays of numerical data.

It has features that allow you to easily to arithmetic on large vectors, matrices, and n-dimensional arrays

# pandas
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a package for working with data frames which can be thought of as tables where each row and each column has a label.
This is also the fundamental abstraction in the SQL database language. Pandas has features for reading a data set into a data frame from a csv file, and supports a large number of operations on data frames (selecting subsets, forming pivot tables, adding and remove rows and columns, plotting, joining two tables on a column, forming new data tables by combining like values, etc.)
