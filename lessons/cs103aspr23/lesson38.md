# Building Mobile apps with React Native
Today we give a quick intro to React Native, which is a version of React
that runs as a native app on iPhones, iPads, and Android devices

The main differences between React Native and React are that React Native
* uses its own components for the User Interface
* has its own development tools for running the app on your device
* has components corresponding to all of the features on your phone (camera, microphone, accelerometer, contact list, etc.)

We'll give an intro by working through the [Getting Started Tutorial](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/introduction/)
and the [expo.dev](https://expo.dev) website.
