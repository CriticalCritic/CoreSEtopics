# Advanced Pandas Features

We talk ahout more advanced features of Pandas
using the Brandeis class data in [data2.zip](https://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~tim/cs103aspr23/)
and the Jupyter notebooks in [Lesson 17](https://github.com/tjhickey724/cs103aspr23/tree/main/lesson17)

The main feature we explore is the groupby method which partitions the rows based on their values in a specified list of columns,
and then aggregates the values of some other column to create a new dataframe.
